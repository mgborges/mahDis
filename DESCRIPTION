Description: This comparison method combines multidimensional scaling (MDS) data with permutation tests. Our strategy uses MDS to project the data onto lower dimensions, while preserving the distance between the data points. Using these projections, we determine the Mahalanobis distance between the groups and estimates the null distribution of the distances between the groups using permutation. The strategy uses this distribution to assess the evidences of differences between the groups.
